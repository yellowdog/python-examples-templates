# YellowDog Python Examples Templates

This repository contains example template solutions for use with the [Python Examples](https://github.com/yellowdog/python-examples) command line scripts, along with other resources for use with YellowDog.

## Getting Started with YellowDog

Please see the **[YellowDog Quickstart](quickstart.md)** instructions for a fast path to getting started with YellowDog Cloud-Provisioned Worker Pools, and/or see the **[YellowDog Quickstart for Configured Worker Pools](quickstart-configured.md)** for setting up self-managed (e.g., on premise) Worker Pools.

## YellowDog Agent Installation

The YellowDog Scheduler requires instances to run the YellowDog Agent in order to participate in Worker Pools. Please see the links below for help with installing the Agent on Linux and Windows systems.
